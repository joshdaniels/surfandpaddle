Homework today is to recreate the Surf and Paddle mockup. Both the mockup and the images folder is attached below in a zip file.

This needs to be as pixel perfect as you can make it.

To help in this, I want you to use normalize.css which is a good css reset and will help you. 
You can find that here - http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

Also, you will need to utilize Google Fonts - http://www.google.com/fonts
The fonts used in this mockup are (Oswald and Myriad Pro) you can substitute Myriad Pro with PT Sans though.

This homework is due Monday morning by 9am and should be uploaded to your Github account titled something like "Surf and Paddle".
